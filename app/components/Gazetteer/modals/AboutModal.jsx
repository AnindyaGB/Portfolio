        <p>Hi! Welcome to Gazetteer</p>
        <p>Gazetteer is an interactive geospatial web application that allows users to explore countries around the world and instantly access key geographic, demographic, and weather information.</p>
        <p>Users can select or click on a country, and then use the tools to either view information or interact with the map. I encourage you to experiment with the toolbar!</p>
        <p>Built using React, Leaflet, and modern web APIs, Gazetteer demonstrates dynamic data fetching, geospatial visualization, and responsive UI design.</p>
